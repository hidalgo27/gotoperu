The approaching risk of the extending Inca Empire may have pushed them to make the move. The versatility of their reed islands would have been a helpful and reliable defense mechanism. Today, the people of Uros individuals live on around 60 islands and each home is between 3 to 10 families, which are commonly moored in northeast part of Puno Peru.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, families welcome many travelers in their floating houses. The Uros Islands have become a more favourite route among travelers than Lake Titicaca islands, yet this doesn't mean this is not worth visiting.</p>
